// The term "ternary" refers to something composed of three parts. In the context of programming a ternary expression, also known as
// as the ternary operator or conditional operator, is named because it involves three operands.

// condition? expressionIfTrue: epxressionIfFalse

// BreakDown:

// Condition: The first operand is a condition that evaluates to a boolean(true of false)
// expressionIfTrue: The second operand is an expression that gets evaluated and return if the condition is true
// epxressionIfFalse: The third operand is an expression that gets evaluated and if the condtion id false

// Example:

let age = 20;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canVote); // Output:Yes
