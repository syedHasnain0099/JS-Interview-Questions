Single Page Application:

Is a web application or website that interacts with user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of loading new pages. This provides a more fluid user experience, similar to a desktop application. Key Characteristics of SPAs include:

Dynamic Content Loading: SPAs load content dynamically without refreshing the entire page.
Client-Side Routing: SPAs often use client-side routing to handle navigation, meaning URLs change without triggering a full page reload.
Enhanced User Experience:SPAs generally offer faster load times and a smoother user experience becuase only the necessary content is updated.

Making a single page application seo-friendly

SSR(server-side rendering):
Involves the rendering initial html content on the server anf sending it to the client. This allows search engines to crawl and index the content more effectively

Pre-rendering:
Pre-rendering generates static html files at build time, ensuring that search engines have content to index without relying in javascript execution

Dynamic Rendering:
Dynamic rendering serves different content to search engines and users. The server detects the user agent and serves pre-rendered HTML to crawlers while delivering the spa to regular users

Summary:
Making an SPA SEO-friendly requires additional steps compared to traditional multi-page applications. By implementing server-side rendering, pre-rendering, dynamic-rendering and other best practices, you can improve the discoverability and indexing of your SPA by search engines ultimately its seo performance
